##### STEPS TO GENERATE EXECUTABLE###########

* Go to directory where your external system chaincode is located
For example: <GOPATH>/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/test/extscc/fixtures/src/github.com/extscc_cc

* run 'go build' command on your external system chaincode
For example : go run extscc_cc.go

* Copy generated executable file to this directory

* Make sure path specified under "chaincode.systemext.extscc.path" in core.yaml points to the generated executable file
