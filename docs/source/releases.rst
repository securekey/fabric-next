Known Issues & Workarounds
--------------------------
The fabric-ccenv image which is used to build chaincode, currently includes
the github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim ("shim") package.
This is convenient, as it provides the ability to package chaincode
without the need to include the "shim". However, this may cause issues in future
releases (and/or when trying to use packages which are included by the "shim").

In order to avoid any issues, users are advised to manually vendor the "shim"
package with their chaincode prior to using the peer CLI for packaging and/or
for installing chaincode.

Please refer to `FAB-5177 <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5177>`__ for more details,
and kindly be aware that given the above, we may end up changing the
fabric-ccenv in the future.

`v1.1.0-preview <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.1.0-preview>`__ - November 1, 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a *preview* release of the up-coming 1.1 release. We are not feature
complete for 1.1 just yet, but we wanted to get the following functionality
published to gain some early community feedback on the following features:

  - `FAB-2331 <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2331>`__ - Node.js Chaincode
  - `FAB-5363 <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5363>`__ - Node.js SDK Connection Profile

Known Issues & Workarounds

BCCSP content in the configtx.yaml has been `removed <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/a997c30>`__. This change will cause a panic when running `configtxgen` tool with a configtx.yaml file that includes the removed BCCSP content.

Java Chaincode support has been disabled until post 1.0.0 as it is not yet fully mature. It may be re-enabled for experimentation by cloning the hyperledger/fabric repository, reversing `this commit <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/29e0c40>`__ and building your own fork.
