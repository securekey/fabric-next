Known Issues & Workarounds
--------------------------
Previous releases included example input files for configtxgen (configtx.yaml)
that contained invalid YAML. This was discovered as we were moving to a newer
YAML parser.

While we have corrected the examples, users are advised to evaluate their
configtxgen input documents for places were YAML anchors are referenced before
they are defined. Nodes should be reordered to ensure anchors are defined
before referenced.

Please refer to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10151 for more
details.
